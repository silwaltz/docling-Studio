/**
 * Surface gating (#257) + mode gating (#210).
 *
 * Surface: two master flags select which UI surface is exposed. When a
 * route from a disabled surface is requested, redirect to the other
 * surface's landing page — or to `/` if both are off (defensive net;
 * backend refuses to start in that state).
 *
 * Mode: inside the doc workspace, the requested mode falls back to the
 * first enabled mode when the deep-linked one is off.
 *
 * Why the guard is async: this guard reads `studioModeEnabled` /
 * `ragPipelineEnabled` which come from `/api/health`. main.ts kicks off
 * `load()` eagerly so it's typically in flight (or done) by the time the
 * first navigation hits this guard, but on a cold cache the navigation
 * still needs to wait — otherwise the guard reads the store's defaults
 * (`studio=false, rag=true`) and the legacy `/studio` deep-link gets
 * silently redirected to `/docs` on first load. `load()` is idempotent
 * (single in-flight promise, no-op when already loaded) so awaiting it
 * here costs nothing after the first nav, and avoids a timing race
 * without a magic timeout.
